### Core Architecture Patterns

**ProductManager Module** (Closure Pattern):
```javascript
const ProductManager = (function() {
    // Private state variables
    let products = [];
    let materials = [];
    let groups = [];
    
    // Private functions
    function calculateCosts() { /* ... */ }
    function updateCostBreakdown() { /* ... */ }
    
    // Public API
    return {
        init: function() { /* ... */ },
        saveProduct: function() { /* ... */ },
        exportCSV: function() { /* ... */ }
    };
})();
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### For Developers

The codebase follows a clean separation of concerns:

- **`productManager.js`**: Core business logic using closure pattern for data encapsulation
- **`app.js`**: UI event bindings and view navigation
- **`popup.js`**: Reusable modal dialog system
- **`index.html`**: Single-page application with embedded CSS

### Key Design Principles

1. **Closure-based Encapsulation**: Private state management with controlled public API
2. **Real-time Updates**: Immediate calculation updates as users input data
3. **localStorage Persistence**: Automatic data saving with migration support
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with flexible grid layouts
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript enhancements

### Data Structures

**Product Object**:
```javascript
{
    id: Number,
    name: String,
    groupId: Number,
    materials: Array<{name: String, cost: Number}>,
    laborCost: Number,
    overheadCost: Number,
    postCost: Number,
    packagingCost: Number,
    retailPrice: Number,
    marketplaces: Array<{id: Number, fee: Number, profit: Number}>
}
```
